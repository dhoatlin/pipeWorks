Pipeworks is a program that bounces a drone around inside a box.

There are two versions of this program.

dynamicPipe takes two parameters describing the number of rows and columns within the box.
Each cell is its own process and needs to talk to adjacent processes in order to pass the drone on.
Every process/cell has its own struct defining boundries and pipes to neighbors making certain checks
(like testing boundries) a lot easier.

pipe takes no parameters and just creates a box with 4 sections. This uses an old version of process cells
that I got rid of in dynamicPipe.
